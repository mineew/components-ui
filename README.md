## About

UI Components Library built with ⚛️ **React**, 💨 **TailwindCSS** and ⚡️ **Zag**
for use in my personal projects

Compatible with 📋 **React Hook Form**

## Installation

First, install the package:

```bash
npm install @mineew/components-ui
```

Then be sure to configure your template paths in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./node_modules/@mineew/components-ui/**/*'],
};
```

## Documentation

There is no documentation as such because I don't think anyone can be
interested in this library except myself.

But you can see examples in 📚 [Storybook](https://mineew.github.io/components-ui/).
